                <h3>Magic's original Constructed deck size was 40 cards.</h3>
                <p>If you wanted to build a Constructed deck when Limited Edition (Alpha) came out, your deck didn't
                    have to be 60 cards. That's because when the game first started the deck construction minimum was 40
                    cards, with no limit as to how many copies of a card you could have. This was based around the idea
                    that players wouldn't own all that many cards and a 40-card deck would allow them to make multiple
                    decks with the cards they owned.

                    When Wizards finally put out official tournament rules, they made 60-card decks the official minimum
                    as well as adding the four-card limit. These were both based off of informal rules that had been
                    adopted on the West Coast. Shortly after this happened, the official rules were changed to a 60-card
                    minimum with the four-copy limit. The 40-card limit was kept for Limited play.
